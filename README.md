This module contains an algorithm for extracting messages from
an email. The main purpose of the creation of this algorithm is to
ease document controling works in my office, so we can monitor
incoming and sent emails slightly authomatically. The algorithm uses
`imaplib` and `email` libraries in Python. This algorithm is still
in development and still needs a lot of improvements.
